# CureBay Backend - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. MongoDB Duplicate Index Warning
**Problem**: The server was showing a warning about duplicate schema index on {"code":1} in the Coupon model.

**Root Cause**: The Coupon model had both `unique: true` on the code field and a separate index definition `CouponSchema.index({ code: 1 })`, which created a duplicate index.

**Fix**: Removed the explicit index definition since `unique: true` already creates an index.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/models/Coupon.js`
- `dist/models/Coupon.js`

**Change Made**:
```javascript
// Before
const CouponSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    code: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true,  // This already creates an index
        trim: true,
        uppercase: true
    },
    // ... other fields
});

// Index for better query performance
CouponSchema.index({ code: 1 });  // Duplicate index - removed this line
CouponSchema.index({ startDate: 1, endDate: 1 });
CouponSchema.index({ isActive: 1 });

// After
const CouponSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    code: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true,  // This already creates an index
        trim: true,
        uppercase: true
    },
    // ... other fields
});

// Index for better query performance
// Removed duplicate index on code since unique: true already creates an index
CouponSchema.index({ startDate: 1, endDate: 1 });
CouponSchema.index({ isActive: 1 });
```

### 2. Excessive Verbose Logging
**Problem**: The server was outputting too many unnecessary log messages during startup, making it harder to identify important information.

**Fix**: Removed all the verbose console.log statements that were only useful during development.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/index.js`
- `dist/index.js`

**Changes Made**:
- Removed all console.log statements related to middleware registration
- Removed debug middleware that logged every request
- Kept only essential logging (server start, MongoDB connection success/failure)
- Simplified 404 handler to not log the request path

## Verification

After applying these fixes:
1. The MongoDB duplicate index warning should no longer appear
2. Server startup logs should be much cleaner and more concise
3. All functionality should remain intact

## How to Apply

1. Ensure both source files (`src/models/Coupon.js` and `src/index.js`) and compiled files (`dist/models/Coupon.js` and `dist/index.js`) are updated with the changes above
2. Restart the server with `npm start`
3. Verify that the warning is gone and logs are cleaner
